## 🎯 Project Overview

This project addresses two critical challenges in modern machine learning: **algorithmic fairness** and **imbalanced data handling**. We implement cutting-edge techniques to ensure AI systems are both accurate and ethically responsible.

### 🔑 Key Components

#### **Part 1: Bias Detection & Application**
- ✅ **Bias Detection Algorithms** - Systematic identification of algorithmic bias
- ✅ **Fairness Metrics Implementation** - Demographic parity, equalized odds
- ✅ **Real-world Applications** - Practical bias mitigation strategies

#### **Part 2: Imbalanced Data Solutions**
- ✅ **Advanced Sampling Techniques** - SMOTE, ADASYN, borderline sampling
- ✅ **Cost-sensitive Learning** - Weighted algorithms and threshold optimization
- ✅ **Ensemble Methods** - Balanced bagging and boosting approaches

## ⚖️ Ethical AI Framework

### **Fairness Principles**
- **Individual Fairness** - Similar individuals receive similar treatment
- **Group Fairness** - Protected groups receive equitable outcomes  
- **Counterfactual Fairness** - Decisions unchanged in counterfactual world
- **Causal Fairness** - Addressing discrimination through causal reasoning

### **Bias Mitigation Strategies**
- **Pre-processing** - Data transformation and resampling
- **In-processing** - Fairness-constrained optimization
- **Post-processing** - Output calibration and threshold adjustment

## 📊 Implementation Highlights

### **Fairness Metrics**
```python
# Core fairness evaluation metrics
def demographic_parity(y_true, y_pred, sensitive_attr):
    # Implementation of demographic parity
    
def equalized_odds(y_true, y_pred, sensitive_attr):
    # Implementation of equalized odds
    
def fairness_score(y_true, y_pred, sensitive_attr):
    # Comprehensive fairness assessment
```

### **Imbalanced Data Techniques**
```python
# Advanced resampling methods
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE, ADASYN
from imblearn.under_sampling import TomekLinks
from imblearn.ensemble import BalancedBagging

# Custom implementations for specific use cases
